### The All Stocks Analysis evalutaes the selected stocks in the year either 2017 or 2018, depending on which one Steve is evaluating. By running the macro for each year, the yearly return will populate for each stock. Although the majority of the stocks are up in the year 2017, most of them decreased in the year 2018. If Steve is basing his analysis off of 2018, he might recommend ENPH and RUN since they have yearly returns of 81.92% and 83.95% respectively.
